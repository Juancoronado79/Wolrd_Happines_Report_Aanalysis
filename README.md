# Data Sourcing
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)

The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll, based on responses to the Cantril ladder question. This question asks respondents to rate their current lives on a scale from 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life). The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use Gallup weights for representation. Additional columns estimate the contribution of six factors—economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity—to the happiness scores.
